# Build a todo list component using Angular
Requirements:   
a. Users should able to add items to the list:

- Use an \<input\> element to accept user input for the todo list item.
- Use a button \<button> element to append the text in the <input> element as an item to the list and clear the <input> element.
- Use \<li> elements for todo list items as children of \<ul> element. Todo list items should not be empty and there can be multiple items with the same value.   

b. users should be able to mark/unmark items as completed:
 
- Cross (strikethrough) the \<li> element when clicked indicate that the item is completed and add "is-done" class to the \<li> element.
- Undo the cross when the item is clicked again and remove "is-done" class from the \<li> element.

c. users should be able to track progress:

- Display a status message with the number of remaining tasks as "X remaining out of Y tasks", where X = the number of incomplete tasks. Y = the tital number of items in list. Add "task-counter" class to the status message \("X remaining out of Y tasks") element.
